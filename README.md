# RealmBinary

This module vends the Realm binary for use in other modules. To re-generate the binary

1. Download the latest version of the Realm binary from the [Realm website](https://realm.io/docs/get-started/installation/mac/). You are looking for Realm.spm.zip and RealmSwift@x.x.x.spm zip.
2. Open up Package.swift and update links.
3. Get the checksum of the new binaries: `swift package compute-checksum RealmSwift@x.x.spm.zip`. This is the checksum of the zip file, not the extracted framework.
4. Check Realm and RealmSwift header files and modulemaps to see if there are changes. If there are, just replace with the latest files.
